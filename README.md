# Mastering Pinia Exercises

![Hero Image](./public/hero-image.svg)

Welcome to **Mastering Pinia**! To get started, run the following command:

```bash
npx zx@7.2 https://esm.is/mastering-pinia
```

This will create a `mastering-pinia-exercises` folder with all the exercises in your Home folder. You can pass a
different path as `--dir` or as the last argument to the command to change the location of the folder.

```bash
npx zx@7.2 https://esm.is/mastering-pinia --dir my-folder
```

> **Note**
>
> This also allows to update the exercises to the latest version by running the same command!
